# Tennis Ball Detection Using YOLOv5 and Kalman Filter  

This project implements a real-time tennis ball detection and tracking system using the YOLOv5 object detection model and a Kalman filter for tracking. The combination of YOLOv5's detection capabilities with the predictive tracking of a Kalman filter ensures robust and smooth tracking of a tennis ball in dynamic scenes.

## Introduction  

This project aims to detect and track a tennis ball in real-time using video feeds or pre-recorded footage. YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, is used to identify the tennis ball in the frame, while the Kalman filter is employed to predict its position in subsequent frames, smoothing the trajectory and handling temporary detection failures.

## Features  

- **Real-time Detection**: Leverages YOLOv5 for high-speed, accurate tennis ball detection.  
- **Predictive Tracking**: Uses Kalman filter to maintain smooth tracking and predict ball positions.  
- **Robust to Occlusions**: Kalman filter ensures tracking even when the ball is temporarily obscured.
